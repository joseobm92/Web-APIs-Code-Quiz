## Description

- My motivation for this project was to apply the skills, knowledge, and tools learned on class related to Javascript to provide logic and style using the DOM, along with some CSS and HTML.
- I built this project with the intention of putting in practice my ability to use arrays, functions, methods, loops among other things to create a Coding Quiz and provide the different logical steps happening behind the screen. 
- The code was created to show some HTML, proper CSS styling elements, and JavaScript logic and styling.
- I learned how to properly use the Javascript files to traverse into an HTML and CSS by using variables, functions, the DOM, if statemets, loops, methods among other things to provide logic and style to the Code Quiz.
